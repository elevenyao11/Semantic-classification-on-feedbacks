Title: week 4 partner-mentor-member meeting minutes

Time: 20210601 1400 PT

Place: Zoom

Attendees:  partner, mentor and all 4 members

 

**DONE**:

- Progress update for partner re:
	- unsupervised learning
		- hierarchical clustering 
		- k-means clustering
		- BERT topic
	- supervised learning	
		- domain prediction accuracy: 93%
		- tag prediction accuracy: 73% - 86%
	- linguistic features
		- semantic roles etc.

**TODO**:

- Partner suggestion:
	-  focus on clustering / topic modeling
		-  if time, improve text classification
		-  if still time, work on features for human
	-  for next meeting with partners, compare performances of classification models (existing and MDS-CL's)

- Mentor suggestion:
	- for text classification:  
	show how confident the model is with the classification of a tag (for example, >80% means confident)
	- for clustering:  
	show % of tags that already labelled in the same tag annotated by human, for example,
		- \>80% means homogeneous already
		- <20% means heterogeneous (new information! attention needed)
	- if time, try presenting noun phrase, named entity, chunking or dependency, for human.
