Place: Zoom

Attendees:  partner, mentor and all 4 members

 

**DONE**:

- Progress update for partner

- Partner's answers to questions:

	1. it would be good if we can predict domain, in addition to tag
	
	2. We need not automatically let the model to name new tags. We could instead provide features(sentiment, NER, etc.) of a topic, so human reviewer can use them to do the naming. 
	
	3. A possible range for Number of clusters is: 3-20.  
	Threshold of min(count-of-comments or % of comments) in a topic = TBD
	
 


**TODO**:

as discussed in extended mentor-member session after the partner-mentor-member meeting:

1. Keep working on linguistic features
2. Research on how to add SRL / Dependency features as input for a larger model
3. experiment on Hierarchical clustering
